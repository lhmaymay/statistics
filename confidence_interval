One sample proportion test 
Null hypotheses: p=p0
Z=(p-p0)/sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n)                                          reject if z > 1.96
Confidence inrerval: p +- 1.96 sqrt (p(1-p)/n)


What Is Confidence Interval?
A confidence interval, in statistics, refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
A confidence interval displays the probability that a parameter will fall between a pair of values around the mean.
Confidence intervals measure the degree of uncertainty or certainty in a sampling method.
They are most often constructed using confidence levels of 95% or 99%.
