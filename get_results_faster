Getting results faster: 
1: Increase sample size. Product adjustment (increase sample size, increase eligible population
2: Variance reduction 
(AA pre adjustment CUPED controlled experiment using pre-experiment data): need to have repeated user or using registration information)
3: Sequential probability ratio test (peeking with sequential test)
4: Fast surrogate

How are surrogate metrics calculated?
As noted above, a surrogate metric is a prediction of the north star metric using predictors observed during our experiment.

shor term index of long term metrics (LCV, retention)

5: Bandits design
