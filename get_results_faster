Getting results faster: 
1: Increase sample size. Product adjustment (increase sample size, increase eligible population

2: Variance reduction 
(AA pre adjustment CUPED controlled experiment using pre-experiment data): need to have repeated user or using registration information)

3: Sequential probability ratio test (peeking with sequential test)

4: Fast surrogate

How are surrogate metrics calculated?
As noted above, a surrogate metric is a prediction of the north star metric using predictors observed during our experiment.

shor term index of long term metrics (LCV, retention)
when conducting experiments we look to use our metric variance to determine the “acceptable” range of values. If our observed treatment exceeds that range, 
we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our treatment had a statistically significant impact.
The larger our prediction error, the larger our “acceptable” range, leading to a low-powered test. In short, less variation in our prediction interval increases our 
ability to detect statistically significant changes.
So, when implementing a surrogate metric, try to use a feature set and algorithm that has a low variance confidence interval around the prediction.
