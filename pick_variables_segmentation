After the metric, pick the variables you think would matter to move that metric. Almost always a
combination of user characteristics (sex, age, country, # of friends, etc.) and related to their
browsing/online behavior (device, they came from ads/SEO/direct link, session time, etc.).


There are two key differences between
demographic and behavioral/browsing data. 
People are actually really likely to buy products not only for themselves. It can be a gift, it can be a relative
or friend asking them to buy it on-line for them, or many other reasons. Models only built on demographic
data have no information about this, but assume users will buy for themselves. Looking at a user browsing
history gives information about what a user is interested in buying regardless of whether it is a gift or for
herself.
