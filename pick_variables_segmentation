After the metric, pick the variables you think would matter to move that metric. Almost always a
combination of user characteristics (sex, age, country, # of friends, etc.) and related to their
browsing/online behavior (device, they came from ads/SEO/direct link, session time, etc.).


There are two key differences between
demographic and behavioral/browsing data. 
People are actually really likely to buy products not only for themselves. It can be a gift, it can be a relative
or friend asking them to buy it on-line for them, or many other reasons. Models only built on demographic
data have no information about this, but assume users will buy for themselves. Looking at a user browsing
history gives information about what a user is interested in buying regardless of whether it is a gift or for
herself.

In advertising, timing is the most important thing. You want to predict when a user is interested in buying
something. Demographic information can tell you, for instance, that users of a certain age tend to buy a
certain product. Browsing data tells the moment in which a certain user is thinking about buying a product.
This is orders of magnitude more useful, especially in the online ad business that's largely based on
monetizing clicks. So they make money if the user clicks on the ad right when they show it to them.
Famously, Facebook revenue spiked when they moved from demographic-based ads to using browsing data.
