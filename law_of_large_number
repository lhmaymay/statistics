In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, 
the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are
performed.

The law of large numbers states that an observed sample average from a large sample will be close to the true population average and that it will get closer the larger the sample.
The law of large numbers does not guarantee that a given sample, especially a small sample, will reflect the true population characteristics or that a sample which does not reflect
the true population will be balanced by a subsequent sample.

In business, the term "law of large numbers" is sometimes used in a different sense to express the relationship between scale and growth rates.
