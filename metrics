Define the metric. Pretty much all case studies start with a vague goal and the first step is translating that
into a metric that can be optimized. I.e. "I define engagement on FB as the proportion of users who take at
least one action per day where action means interacting with the site, i.e. posting, liking, uploading a
picture, etc". As long as it makes sense, it doesn't matter much how the metrics is exactly defined, like
which thresholds you choose (once a day in this example) or which actions you choose to include or
whether you say average actions per user instead of pct of users above a certain threshold. But it is
crucial to define a concrete metric. For instance, response rate on Quora would not be a concrete metric.
It can't be evaluated, it is too vague. But percentage of questions that get at least one response within a
day is a metric. 

As a general advice, try to pick a metric that is related to the company mission. Like FB cares about
interactions between users, that's why above we picked actions that incentivize that. Quora cares about
high level content, so you might always want to include some quality measure (ex: responses with at least
3 up-votes within the first day), Airbnb is about "belonging anywhere" so focus on the fact that if you want
to go to a given place, you can do it, etc. Especially Silicon Valley companies love these things
