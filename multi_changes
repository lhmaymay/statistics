changes:
new UI
new ML algorithm behind the UIC

3 groups:
you need to test each component separately. After all, the whole point of A/B testing is to
isolate the effect of just one change. A way to exactly isolate the two components is to run 3 versions of the site
at the same time:
Version 1 is the old version
Version 2 is the site with the People You May Know Feature, where suggestions are based on the
machine learning model that was developed
Version 3 is the site with the People You May Know Feature, but suggestions are random


This approach is risky though cause users in version 3 might lose faith in the feature, and once users decide a
new feature is bad, it is really hard to make them change their mind.

A milder approach would be to replace random suggestions with something super basic, which machine
learning should easily beat, but that still makes sense. For instance, you can use a history-based model
(suggest users whose profiles were visited in the past by that user) or simply suggest users with the highest
number of shared connections. These versions will still give a baseline to compare your model to, without
giving users in one test group the impression that your new feature is very stupid.
