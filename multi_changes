3 groups:
you need to test each component separately. After all, the whole point of A/B testing is to
isolate the effect of just one change. A way to exactly isolate the two components is to run 3 versions of the site

Version 2 is the site with the People You May Know Feature, where suggestions are based on the
machine learning model that was developed
Version 3 is the site with the People You May Know Feature, but suggestions are random
