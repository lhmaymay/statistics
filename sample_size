sample size or test duration


It is extremely unlikely that they want the actual formula here (although it wouldn't hurt knowing it). Usually, they
want to know which parameters you need to define in order to estimate the sample size. That is:
Significance level, usually 0.05
Power, usually 0.8
Expected standard deviation of the change in the metric
Minimum effect size you are interested in detecting via your tes

Via those values, you will be able to get the sample size required for your t-test. Then, by knowing how many
users you have per day, you can estimate how many days it will take to reach the required sample size with a
50/50 test-control split. If the final number is larger than 14 days, you are done. That's the number of days
required. 
If the final number is less than 14 days, you still want to run the test for 14 days in order to reliably capture
weekly patterns. In this case, you might want to change the test-control split accordingly (like for instance 20%
test and 80% control if 20% of users per day * 14 gives you the required sample size). That way you will still
