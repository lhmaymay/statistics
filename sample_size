sample size or test duration


It is extremely unlikely that they want the actual formula here (although it wouldn't hurt knowing it). Usually, they
want to know which parameters you need to define in order to estimate the sample size. That is:
Significance level, usually 0.05
Power, usually 0.8
Expected standard deviation of the change in the metric
Minimum effect size you are interested in detecting via your tes
