change in user distribution

A change in user distribution is something that happens quite often (or at least should happen!). Early users are
more tech-savvy and have in general different characteristics than the new users a company will acquire later
on in its life. There is no reason to assume that a test that failed last year should also fail this year, if user base
has evolved.

It is therefore pretty common to look back at past tests and see if it makes sense to re-run one of them. A
frequent way to see if it makes sense to re-run a test is to look at past test results, change the underlying
distribution of users giving weights so that it resembles the current distribution, and see if results are promising

"What's the major drawback of A/B testing?".
They are all hinting at the same thing as the question above. The fact that A/B test results are not telling you in
absolute terms which version is better. They are telling you which version is better given your current user
base, which is the data you use to test.

Matter of fact, it can be dangerous for a small company to over optimize using A/B testing on the entire
population and to only look at the overall results. They might end up with a great site for tech-savvy and early
adopter people, but never grow beside them, essentially finding local optima.
