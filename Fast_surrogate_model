Fast surrogate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_model

A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. 
Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective
and constraint functions as a function of design variables.
