 the probability of being an outlier on at least one dimension is 1 minus the probability of
being within the 95% range for all the variables. That is, 1 - 0.95^100. This number is larger than 99%! 
That essentially means that in high dimension every event is almost guaranteed to be an outlier on at least one
dimension. If you imagine an n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features, all events will end up
close to the border and the center will be empty. This is pretty much another way to rephrase the curse of
dimensionality and has huge negative implications when it comes to modeling.
