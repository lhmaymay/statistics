1: How to calculate variance when independence assumption is violated 
Bootstrapping: non-parametric method , 
Delta method:  The 'delta' method, also known as 'propagation of errors', is a useful way to estimate variances of functions of random variables. 
When A, B are normal , f(A,B) variance  = (df/dA  df/dB) * SIGMA * (df/dA  df/dB)`.
 The 'delta method' is based on the first-degree Taylor's expansion of the function f(A, B), and requires that the function be at least differentiable.
It generalizes to higher dimensions in a straightforward way.
Now let f(X, Y) = X / Y.  Then the estimated variance of f(Abar, Tbar) is
[1]  (df/dX)^2 * var(Abar) + 2*(df/dX)*(df/dY)*cov(Abar, Tbar) + (df/dY)^2 * var(Tbar).
Here df/dX will be evaluated at X = Abar, Y = Tbar.
Note that df/dX = 1/Y and df/dY = -X/Y^2.
The rest is arithmetic, inserting the right numbers into
