Effect size:It is simply a way of quantifying the size of the difference between two groups. Effect size is the magnitude of the difference between groups.
It is a simple way of quantifying the difference between two groups that has many advantages over the use of tests of statistical significance alone. Effect size 
emphasises the size of the difference rather than confounding this with sample size.
One feature of an effect size is that it can be directly converted into statements about the overlap between the two samples in terms of a comparison of percentiles.
An effect size is exactly equivalent to a 'Z-score' of a standard Normal distribution. For example, an effect size of 0.8 means that the score of the average person 
in the experimental group is 0.8 standard deviations above the average person in the control group, and hence exceeds the scores of 79% of the control group.
