This question is just a fancy way to ask: "Given an item (i.e. you) and a list of item candidates (i.e. your
connections), find the most similar item". If the question were "For each song on Spotify, find the closest song",
it would be very much the same.

As usual, let's start by defining what means closest or most similar in this case. There are infinite ways to
define best friends. Pick one definition that makes sense and move on. What they really want to see here is
that you define it in some ways. If, by the end of this answer, you spent all the time talking about all possible
definitions of best friends and didn't talk about item recommendation from a data science perspective, you
know you have failed.

Once you have all the variables above, you can use any similarity measure (like cosine similarity for instance)
and, for each person, find the closest connection.
