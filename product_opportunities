How would you find out product opportunities?
The easiest way for a data scientist to find product opportunities is by looking at current data and find
something that people are already doing, but in a complicated way requiring multiple steps. Then, simplify that.
Data science excels in identifying and removing inefficiencies. Whenever you get questions about new
features, answer from that standpoint. It is the safest bet.

example , whatsapp
A step by step approach to identify these opportunities could be:
Collect messages and cluster them based on their meaning. Focus especially on the first and last of a
conversation, as they tend to be the most informative ones
Look at the most frequent clusters
Figure out a way to allow a user to perform that action with just one click (or even zero) without having to
type a message and/or without leaving WhatsApp
Test on a subset of users if the change is actually successfu
