How would you find out product opportunities?

example , whatsapp
A step by step approach to identify these opportunities could be:
Collect messages and cluster them based on their meaning. Focus especially on the first and last of a
conversation, as they tend to be the most informative ones
Look at the most frequent clusters
Figure out a way to allow a user to perform that action with just one click (or even zero) without having to
type a message and/or without leaving WhatsApp
Test on a subset of users if the change is actually successfu
