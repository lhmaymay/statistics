In a normal distribution, the mean and the median are the same number while the mean and median in a skewed distribution become different numbers:

A left-skewed, negative distribution will have the mean to the left of the median.

A right-skewed distribution will have the mean to the right of the median.

A left-skewed distribution has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called negatively-skewed distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the 
negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the peak.

A right-skewed distribution has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That’s because there is a long tail in the 
positive direction on the number line. The mean is also to the right of the peak.
