If 70% of Facebook users on iOS use Instagram,
but only 35% of Facebook users on Android use
Instagram, how would you investigate the
discrepancy?

OS is just acting as a proxy for other variables


A quick way to check this could be: build a decision tree using user-related variables + OS to predict Instagram
usage. If the tree doesn't significantly use the OS variable, you are sure that it doesn't really matter. In this
case, the tree would split on, for instance, combinations of country and age since that's where most of the
information is. If OS is acting as a proxy for those variables, for sure the tree would choose those other
variables first, as they would allow for a better classification. After those splits, there is no information left to
extract from OS so the tree won't touch it. It is important that you choose a model that works well with
correlated variables, like trees.

You could get similar conclusions by building two models: one including OS and one without. If prediction is the
same, it means there is no information in OS that's not already in the other variables.
Another option would be to generate simulated datasets where you adjust the distributions of all other
variables. So that now you have the same age, country, etc, distribution for both iOS and Android. And check if
proportion of Instagram users is still different or not.
